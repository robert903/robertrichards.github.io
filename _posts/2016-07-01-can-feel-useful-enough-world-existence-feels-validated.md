It was Nietzsche that said our desire to overcome ourselves is the only constant in life.

The direction you take this in determines whether you&#8217;re happy or not. Too many chase the things they want, but usually these aren&#8217;t what they need.

The question then becomes why do I want something I don&#8217;t really need?

For those who seek power. The success, a good looking women and recognition feels necessary to validate their existence.

Sun Tzu wrote about this:
  
All men see my victories, but none see the strategy by which I achieve them.

Approximate reality, both the internal one and the external one. Know yourself, know your opponent and know your environment.

The goal should be to understand the workings of everything, so that you may build efficiently.

What you decide to build is based on your knowledge of self. How you build is based on the knowledge of the environment.
