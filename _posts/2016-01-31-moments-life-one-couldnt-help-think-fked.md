  August 14, 1981. Two weeks previously I had told my girlfriend we needed to take a break from our relationship. I told that I didn&#8217;t love her and that there was no future with her. She cried bitterly. She had given me her all. And she left my house and went home. I didn&#8217;t know it then but my entire world was about to fall apart.

  At first I didn&#8217;t know how I felt. I felt strange, different, scared but encouraged by possibility. There was a girl I knew whom I liked, named Beth. Meeting Beth earlier in the year had been frustrating for me because I wasn&#8217;t a cheater but I was really attracted to her. But now that I had driven off my girlfriend, the door was wide open. I invited Beth over and did the entire college seduction thing, draink wine, smoked dope, listend to LPs records of Styx &#8220;Paradise Theater&#8221; and so on. But when I went to make my move she put her hand on my chest and gently pushed me back against the couch. &#8220;We can fuck if you want to,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but I really prefer girls.&#8221;

  Nothing happened that night and later, alone in bed, I started to realize that maybe I had made a mistake. I felt suddenly alone in a large room. And as the days passed I knew something I didn&#8217;t know before &#8212; I loved my now-ex-girlfriend. But it was probably too late. During the day I went through the motions of my college job and hanging out with friends. I biked and swam and enjoyed the summer. I even made an expedition to a large abandoned quarry where college kids hung out and swam in the copper-green water.  But it was all hollow to me. So after about two weeks I broke down and called her up on the phone and asked her to meet me at my apartment. In her happy voice that I was thrilled to hear she agreed. My heart was pounding like a machine gun. If she came back to me I would never think of any other woman again, I thought. I would do everything I could to make it right.

  The next day I was waiting breathlessly for her to arrive, sitting on the couch near the window. And when her car appeared, I jumped up and opened the door and met her on the stairs coming up to my apartment. I was thrilled to notice she was wearing the sexy top I liked so much on her. And then I noticed she was carrying a bag. And all my stuff was in the bag. I knew what that meant. It meant I was fucked.

  She let me kiss her on the cheek. She smelled fresh, of soap and purity. She looked radiant as she came into my apartment. I took the bag and threw it on the couch and took her in my arms and we hugged. But I could tell that there was no intensity from her. And then she pushed me back gently.
</div>

<div class="qtext_para">
  &#8220;I guess this really is good-bye,&#8221; she said to me softly, tears in her eyes.
</div>

<div class="qtext_para">
  &#8220;But I was wrong,&#8221; I said, &#8220;I really do love you.&#8221;
</div>

<div class="qtext_para">
  She just kind of smiled sadly at me, looking up at me. All I could remember at that moment was kissing her in the rain under a streetlamp a year before and how happy I was at that moment. I would never have that again.
</div>

<div class="qtext_para">
  She shook her head imperceptibly.
</div>

<div class="qtext_para">
  &#8220;It&#8217;s too late,&#8221; she whispered. And she softly pushed off from my chest and turned to the door.
</div>

<div class="qtext_para">
  &#8220;Please don&#8217;t go,&#8221; I pleaded. She looked at me with a sad smile, the tears running down her face, and then she went down the stairs and was gone from my life forever.
</div>

<div class="qtext_para">
  I tried everything my broken little mind could think of to get her back &#8212; love letters, intercession by sympathetic family members, threats, oaths, anger, foot stomping, every stupid thing you&#8217;ve ever heard of or thought of. Nothing worked. It was as the poem said, &#8220;Man hath no anger such as love to hatred turned, nor hath Hell a fury as a woman scorned&#8221;.  She was gone. I never spoke to her again. Within six months she was deeply involved with someone else. I tracked her for years. She had twins, just as the Pyschic we visited together for fun one summer at Weir&#8217;s Beach predicted. After that I stopped checking in on her. Ten years had gone by. Sometimes you really don&#8217;t know what you have til it is gone.
