I&#8217;m 48. Here&#8217;s what a man should know.

**A) QUIT YOUR JOB**

You can&#8217;t get rich at a job. You have to get rich by either starting a business or having multiple streams of income.

Don&#8217;t quit your job tomorrow. Be a man. Be responsible. Just do it over time but every day move towards this goal.

Why do you need to get rich? Is this particular to a man?

Not really. Woman should do this also. But historically, men in our society have been the bread earners and you will feel better about yourself if you can do it.

So do it.

**B) DON’T LET SOMEONE ELSE VALIDATE YOU**

If you want to make a TV show, make a video. If you want to write a book, write it and self-publish.

If you want to be an investment banker, find one company that wants to get sold and another company that wants to buy it and put yourself in the middle. You don&#8217;t need to be &#8220;chosen&#8221; by Goldman Sachs.

If you want an education, find a way to learn online. You don&#8217;t need to get a degree in X to be X (unless legally).

**C) HEALTH.**

Men die earlier than women.

There&#8217;s really only three keys to better health. I&#8217;ll add a fourth.

Sleep well. Eat well. Low stress. And to help all of the above go faster, exercise.

Fill in the blanks how you want to get the above done. It doesn&#8217;t matter. As long as you are aware of how important the above four towards living to be 100 with high quality of life then you will do it.

**D) DON’T OUTSOURCE YOUR SELF ESTEEM**

Sometimes I&#8217;ve met a woman and I&#8217;ve basically given her all of my self-esteem to take care of.

Then she gets tired of me, bored of me, and dumps me, and now she&#8217;s taken my self-esteem away until i find it again.

It&#8217;s hard enough for any one person to manage their own self-esteem, let alone yours.

Take care of your own self-esteem.

**E) CREATIVITY**

When you are creative, you become competent. Every day try to do one creative thing a day that makes you feel good.

This is one way to make yourself your priority and never anyone else.

Does this seem selfish? It totally is.

But 1% a day improvement in creativity compounds you into a giant among people.

You will feel good, you will have better relationships with people, you will be able to do what you want.

Oh, there’s one more and it’s basically obvious. Always be honest. See? Obvious.

Do I do these things? I can tell you that when I haven&#8217;t my life has fallen apart. And when I have, I can do whatever I want.
