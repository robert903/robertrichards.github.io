Before life ends, I want to hit all the goals i&#8217;ve set for myself. I have attained so much thus far and I finally know what I really want to do in life. Though I have sacrificed so much to be here, people and <!--more-->lifestyle, I now realize there is still much more to let go of and more to learn. Like how it feels to lose intentionally and further delay my gratification. I know in my heart, I can not connect the dots looking forward as only hindsight is 20/20, but, I trust in my abilities and that somehow in my future the universe will bring everything together.
