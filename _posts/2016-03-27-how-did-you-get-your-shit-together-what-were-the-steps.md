I was 15. My mother had just kicked and beat me while I was curled up in a little ball on the floor wearing nothing but a bath towel. She said, &#8220;as far as I&#8217;m concerned, you do not exist.&#8221;

So, I went to my basement room, got dressed, and crawled out the window.

Homeless, feeling sorry for myself, penniless, I could have gone down some terrible paths.<!--more-->

Instead I went to my friends for help. I spent a lot of time laughing and talking, sometimes all night. I got a job at a pizza place, borrowed clothes. They snuck me in their houses until I could rent a room. I had to drop out of school for a while, but went right back as soon as I had regular housing and food.

The steps most clearly were:

Ask for help.
  
Laugh and talk (and I wrote a lot in my journal).
  
Took any job I could get.
  
Got a home &#8211; took any home I could afford.
  
Went to school.
  
More laughing and talking and writing.
  
There&#8217;s obviously a lot more detail than that. I wrote a whole book. But if you break it down. I think the most important things I did were to keep moving, let go of my pride, ask for help and do whatever I could to survive, while appreciating my friends and still finding ways to have fun, if only just sitting at Denny&#8217;s drinking coffee and talking all night long.

Connection and movement. That&#8217;s what worked for me.
