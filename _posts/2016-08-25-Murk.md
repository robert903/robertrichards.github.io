Today, like everyday before it for a couple weeks now, was pure procrastination. At Times I wonder where I'd end up in the next 5 years.

### Will anything I'm trying to hold onto be in my future?

The lack of motivation gets to me. There's not a single ounce of enthusiasm left. I have been trying to learn how to build websites for 6 years now and I'm finally at a place where i can see the summit flag. The problem is not as clear to me as before. Nothing is as clear to me as before. I'm no longer that young guy as before, a lot has changed I guess. My naivet√©  is my detriment

### I keep comparing myself to other guys my age.

- Why aren't I having more fun?, 
- Why am I wasting my youth?.

Sometimes  it's hard to pinch myself and realize the truth. I'm different. 

- But why do I feel the limbo?, 
- Is this ordained?.  

I guess I will have to trust God and my mentor, Steve, have my best interests in mind.

### I Can't See The Future, Only The Past.

### I Should Trust That Life Will Work Out In My Favor.

### While Doing My Best At Every Step.

### Have Hope That The Stars Will Align For Me To See In The Murky Waters In Which I Try To Swim.
