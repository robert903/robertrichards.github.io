Excerpt from Bob Dylan&#8217;s 1964 song of the same name.

> Come writers and critics
  
> Who prophesize with your pen
  
> And keep your eyes wide
  
> The chance won&#8217;t come again
  
> And don&#8217;t speak too soon
  
> For the wheel&#8217;s still in spin
  
> And there&#8217;s no tellin&#8217; who
  
> That it&#8217;s namin&#8217;
  
> For the loser now
  
> Will be later to win
  
> For the times they are a-changin&#8217;
