Accept the fact that it is never as you want it to be. Acceptance leads to peace. Quicker you believe this, easier will it be to move on.

Prioritize your goals in life. Many of us waste the important years ofÂ  our life over issues which won&#8217;t matter to us in next ten years down the lane. **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Focus on your career</span>**. &#8220;**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">It won&#8217;t wake up in the middle of night and tell you that it doesn&#8217;t love you anymore.&#8221;</span>**<!--more-->

Read good books. Books are the best company to be with. Spend time with your family. **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Family is the only one who will always love you</span>**.

Spend time with real friends who always wish the best for you. Make new friends. Interact with new people. It will open up your mind.

Exercise. Run daily. Join gym. According to a study, physical exercise reduces mental trauma. Do yoga.

Give time to your hobbies. Allot half hour to do whatever you like. Love your life. Don&#8217;t give so much importance to anyone that if they leave, they take away a part of you. Good luck!
