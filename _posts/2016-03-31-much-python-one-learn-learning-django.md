N<span class="inline_editor_value"><span class="rendered_qtext">ot much really.. you can continue learning Python in parallel to learning Django.</span></span>

For understanding most of the Django features you&#8217;ll need to be confortable with this kind of stuff:

<!--more-->

  * General understanding of Python syntax including the role of indentation
  * Python functions including named parameters, default values,Â  \*args and \**kwargs
  * How to import modules and/or specific symbols from other modules
  * Clear understanding of the Python Path concept
  * Familiarity with control structures both conditional and loops
  * Basic string manipulation
  * Clear understanding of at least the basics of lists, tuples and dictionaries including the concept of a sequence and basic slicing syntax
  * Basic understanding of OOP in Python

<span class="inline_editor_value"><span class="rendered_qtext"><br /> Extra knowledge that helps but you can definitely learn in the process are some basics of functional programming and how to use (and ideally write) decorators, some familiarity with the GNU Gettext framework for localization and internationalization, and stuff like that.</span></span>

That&#8217;s the core but I bet it&#8217;s the 20% of Python stuff that will be required for understanding at least the 80% of what Django has to offer. If you&#8217;re proficient in some other language like PHP, Java, C++, Ruby, etc and know the equivalent concepts in any of those languages you can learn all of the above even in just a few hours reviewing the correct learning materials.

As with any language and/or API the rest is tons of practice in order to feel comfortable in the environment without checking the docs every two minutes ðŸ™‚
